# Live Tools

This is for tools that are meant to be run statically from my github URL without needing to run them from anywhere.

So far:

1. **Ken Burns** - this is a helper for calculating properties and keyframes to add for doing Ken Burns style zoom and/or pan on still photos in a Premiere Pro sequence.
1. **Make Tiles** - this is a helper for building sequences of tiled photos in Premiere Pro (primarily to use them as templates).

Right now `docs/index.html` is hardcoded in that location (not deployed from elsewhere). It's just a listing. That can be revisisted later.
